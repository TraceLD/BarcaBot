    <div id="data">
        <h2>Data source</h2>
        <p>BarcaBot requires a lot of data to function, from player stats to the match schedule. I've put a lot of
            thought into where this data should be obtained from. The easiest (and cheapest) solution would be to
            scrape sites like WhoScored, Flashscores, etc. using one of the scraping libraries as that would provide
            access to the largest array of data, however, this solution comes
            with many legal, as well as ethical conerns, and therefore I've deemed it unsuitable. There are football
            stats and data provides such as Opta, but the issue with them is that they can cost hundreds, if not
            thousands of pounds per month.</p>
        <p>
            I've ended up going with a combination of two Freemium APIs - API-FOOTBALL and FootballData. They both
            provide a basic free tier, which I can use for everything BarcaBot needs. Instead of calling the API
            every single time a user requests a command, I'm updating my own database with data on a schedule. This,
            while not providing truly real time data, allows me to essentially
            bypass any rate limits.
